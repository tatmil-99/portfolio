# React Personal Website :fire: :fire: :fire:

### How I Worked On This Project

My goal was to develop project planning skills.

I understood:

- I understood the problem my project was trying to solve, which was to develop
  a site that allowed users to view my resume and portfolio. I knew that I also
  wanted users to know my background, and I knew I wanted them to be able to contact
  me easily.

I planned:

- I drew out component structure.
- I sketched a rough draft of how I wanted UI to look.
- I knew that I wanted a UI and some light user interaction.
- I knew I would recieve user input and return output for my form.
- I tackled problems in a componentized manner, which allowed me to logically break
  up problems and not just attempt to solve the whole project in one go.

I divided:

- I didn't tackle the whole project head on, I tried to better develop my problem
  solving skills and work on problems by chunking -- that is breaking up large
  problems into smaller ones.

### Why I Built This Project

The main reason I built this project was because I was tired of getting ghosted from
jobs I would apply to. After careful evaluation, I decided that maybe
one of the leading reasons was due to my current personal website. It was a template
that I had found and changed some of the code to. After developing my new site for a while,
I quickly realized that my first website was a red flag. It was very obviously a template and
i'm sure employers don't like seeing that from Front End Developer applicants. I also wanted
a personal brand so to speak, something that showed who I was and was fully custom and built
by me.

### What I Learned

I think I learned more building this project than I learned throughout my entire bootcamp.
Some of the things I will undoubtedly lose in memory, but nonetheless I learned a lot --
especially how hard developing projects from scratch is. I spent more time planning than I spent coding. That was a muscle I hadn't really worked yet being caught in tutorial purgatory for so
long. I especially learned that coding is more planning than coding, which was/is weird to me
still. Darn stereotypes!
